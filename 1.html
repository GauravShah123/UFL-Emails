                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to the Fall 2023 term of WPL Reading Buddies! We are so thrilled to be back for another fun term! Thank you so much for your support. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Our First Session</h2>
                    <p>A friendly reminder that our first session will be this <b>Saturday, October 18th</b> from <b>10:00 AM to 11:15 AM ET</b>. We request that you please  arrive <b>15 minutes prior</b> in the Beaupre Room. For all new volunteers, the closest way to access the Beaupre Room is through the front entrance of the McCormick Building; the room is the <b>very first one on your left hand side</b>. You will know youâ€™re in the right place because youâ€™ll see a big hockey rink on your right/across from the room.</p>
                    <p>We will slowly begin pairing you with your buddy as the learners arrive. Please spend the first 10-15 minutes of our program introducing yourself, getting to know your buddy and making nametags with one another.  Some children are a little more outgoing or talkative than others, so it might take more time for your learner to open up to you. This is okay! The important thing is that they know that their learner is there for them regardless. Once you are done, you and your buddy can jump into one-on-one reading for the remainder of the session. ðŸ™‚</p>

                    <p>We will spend the last 10-15 minutes brainstorming and writing down some rules for the room on chart paper together. If you and your buddy come up with a rule during your individual time that you wish to share with the rest of the group, that would be awesome! If not, that is totally okay too. We will have each learner and buddy sign the sheet at the bottom, to feel more like a collaborative effort and to stand as a promise to their peers that they will act with respect and kindness by following our rules. </p>
                    <p>Once learners leave, we will all stay back for a few minutes to debrief and reflect. This is a time where we discuss how the program went, and share successes and challenges. If you would like to share or discuss something with us directly, please feel free to linger behind afterwards. </p><p>
                        If you are unsure about anything or would like to talk, please contact us as soon as possible.
                        </p>
                    <h2>Learner-Buddy Pairings</h2>
                    <p>We have completed the learner-buddy pairings and have posted them onto this spreadsheet below.  Here is where you can discover the name of your learner and possibly a bit about them too. We donâ€™t have information for all of them just yet, but hopefully, we will be able to update/provide more info as it comes from the parents.</p>
